# Secret Santa

Secret Santa but you can help the needy.

## Inspiration

Secret Santa is a common activity in certain companies during the festive season. What if we could apply this to an entire community, with people with diverse needs, to bring the festive cheer to every member of society?
What it does

You can create a profile with your requested gift and the price of gift. Based on the price requested, the website calculates how much you must give to others. If you give 0, you get 25 max, give 50 get 50 max, give 100 get 75 max.

On 18 December, everyone's Secret Santa gets finalized, and people can buy each other gifts.

## How

I used SvelteKit with TailwindCSS as the frontend and Supabase as the backend.
