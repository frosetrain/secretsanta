# Secret Santa

> For BuildingBloCS December Conference 2024 (Group 22)

Secret Santa but you can help the needy. You can make a profile and say what you want for christmas. You also specify your budget for giving. Then you can choose a decoration to put on a christmas tree. Then using some algorithm it will assign a recipient for everyone within their budget, while making sure total cost is equal to total giving. Give 0 get 25 max, give 50 get 50 max, give 100 get 75 max. Once a directed edge is found, the tree decorations become shiny, and a string of shiny lights connects both decorations. (how to implement???)
